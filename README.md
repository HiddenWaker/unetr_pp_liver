# unetr_pp_liver

This model is from UNETR++, implemented for whole liver segmentation. (CT images)

이 모델은 기존 UNETR++에서 whole liver segmentation을 위해 수정된 버전입니다. (CT 이미지)

- This model has been modified to extract only the whole liver from the hepatic vessel CT image.

# Dataset

To quickly check the performance of the UNETR++ model, we used public data produced by Tian et al. https://github.com/GLCUnet/dataset

- Dataset contains annotation of the whole liver.

- We randomly extract 50 nii.gz file from the existing dataset.

- We changed the format of the data to fit the structure of the model. Code for format changing and split (to train and validation) is in [`see_many_files.ipynb`]

- Modified dataset in our UNETR++ for using training is in https://mybox.naver.com/share/list?shareKey=cH_3J5dbnH0kBHWhDIO-1IwswZmfeAnxDSIarIMYfY8A



# Installation
After cloning the repository, install Anoconda3, follow the below steps for installation,
(If all are pre-installed, you can skip this step.)

- Download Anaconda

- Install PyTorch and torchvision 
```
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

- Install other dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Training

For training, you should run through Anaconda, follow the below steps for installation.

- First, create folder 'unetr_plus_plus-main' on your PC, then upload files into the folder.

- Run Anaconda and create virtual enviorment. You can name the virtual environment as you want. 

```
conda activate (put your name of virtual environment)
cd (put your address of folder)\unetr_plus_plus-main
cd (put your address of folder)\unetr_plus_plus-main\training_scripts
sh run_training_synapse.sh
```
- The results of the training are as follows

Batch size | Train loss | Validation loss | Dice score
-- | -- | -- | --
2 | 0.2832 | 0.3127 | 0.9488
**8 (+preprocessing)** | **0.0639** | **0.0896** | **0.9613**
